# Getting Started

## Workspace set up and installation
To get started you will have to make a few decisions and install the repository along with its dependencies. Specifically:
1. Decide if you would like to develop your submission in either Pytorch or Jax.
2. Set up your workstation or VM. We recommend to use a setup similar to the [benchmarking hardware](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/RULES.md#benchmarking-hardware) which consists out of 8 V100 GPUs, 240 GB in RAM and 2 TB in storage for dataset storage. For further recommendations on setting up your own Cloud VM see [here](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/docker/README.md#gcp-integration).
4. Clone the algorithmic-efficiency repository and make sure you have installed the dependencies. To install the dependencies we recommend either:
    1. Installing in a python virtual environment as described in the [Installation section in the README](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/README.md) instructions.
    2. Use a Docker container with dependencies installed. This option will guarantee that you're code is running on the same CUDA, cudnn, and python dependencies as the competition scoring environment. See the [Docker README](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/docker/README.md) for instructions on the Docker workflow.

## Download the data
The workloads in this benchmark use 6 different datasets across 8 workloads. You may choose to download some or all of the datasets as you are developing your submission, but your submission will be scored across all 8 workloads. For instructions on obtaining and setting up the datasets see [datasets/README](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/datasets/README.md#dataset-setup).


## Develop your submission
To develop a submission you will write a python module containing your optimizer algorithm. Your optimizer must implement a set of predefined API methods for the initialization and update steps.

### Set up your directory structure (Optional)
Make a submissions subdirectory to store your submission modules e.g. `algorithmic-effiency/submissions/my_submissions`.

### Coding your submission
You can find examples of sumbission modules under `algorithmic-efficiency/baselines` and `algorithmic-efficiency/reference_algorithms`. \
A submission for the external ruleset will consist of a submission module and a tuning search space definition.
1. Copy the template submission module `submissions/template/submission.py` into your submissions directory e.g. in `algorithmic-efficiency/my_submissions`.
2. Implement at least the methods in the template submission module. Feel free to use helper functions and/or modules as you see fit. Make sure you adhere to to the competition rules. Check out the guidelines for [allowed submissions](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/RULES.md#disallowed-submissions), [disallowed submissions](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/RULES.md#disallowed-submissions) and pay special attention to the [software dependencies rule](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/RULES.md#software-dependencies).
3. Add a tuning configuration e.g. `tuning_search_space.json` file to your submission directory. For the tuning search space you can either:
    1. Define the set of feasible points by defining a value for "feasible_points" for the hyperparameters:
    ```
    {
        "learning_rate": {
            "feasible_points": 0.999
            },
    }
    ```
    For a complete example see [tuning_search_space.json](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/reference_algorithms/target_setting_algorithms/imagenet_resnet/tuning_search_space.json).

    2. Define a range of values for quasirandom sampling by specifing a "min", "max" and "scaling" 
    keys for the hyperparameter:
    ```
    {
        "weight_decay": {
            "min": 5e-3, "max": 1.0, "scaling": "log"
            }
    }
    ```
    For a complete example see[tuning_search_space.json](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/main/baselines/nadamw/tuning_search_space.json). 


## Run your submission
TODO(kasimbeg): Add script to run all workloads?

You can evaluate your submission with the `submission_runner.py` module on one workload at a time. 
To run 

### JAX submissions
To score your submission on a workload, from the algorithmic-efficency directory run: 
```bash
python3 submission_runner.py \
    --framework=jax \
    --workload=mnist \
    --experiment_dir=<path_to_experiment_dir>\
    --experiment_name=<experiment_name> \
    --submission_path=<path_to_submission_module> \
    --tuning_search_space=<path_to_tuning_search_space>
```

### PyTorch submissions
To score your submission on a workload, from the algorithmic-efficency directory run: 
```bash
python3 submission_runner.py \
    --framework=pytorch \
    --workload=<workload> \
    --experiment_dir=<path_to_experiment_dir> \
    --experiment_name=<experiment_name> \
    --submission_path=<path_to_submission_module> \
    --tuning_search_space=<path_to_tuning_search_space>
```

#### PyTorch DDP
We recommend using PyTorch's [Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/ddp_tutorial.html) when using multiple GPUs on a single node. You can initialize ddp with torchrun. 
For example, on single host with 8 GPUs simply replace `python3` in the above command by:
```bash
torchrun --redirects 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0 --standalone --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=N_GPUS
```
So the complete command is:
```bash
torchrun --redirects 1:0,2:0,3:0,4:0,5:0,6:0,7:0 \
    --standalone \
    --nnodes=1 \
    --nproc_per_node=N_GPUS \
    submission_runner.py \
    --framework=pytorch \
    --workload=<workload> \
    --experiment_dir=<path_to_experiment_dir> \
    --experiment_name=<experiment_name> \
    --submission_path=<path_to_submission_module> \
    --tuning_search_space=<path_to_tuning_search_space>
```
